	<h2 class="h2">Welcome to Season 1</h2>
	<p>
		Welcome to the new season. This is dubbed season 1 because we gonna work with a complete new
		score system, design and new features. You can find the <a href="/season-zero"
			>season 0 results</a
		> in the bottom right menu.
	</p>
	<h3 class="h3">Score system</h3>
	<p>
		When you win a match, you start with <span class="positive">10 points</span>. However, this can
		change based on the ranking gap between you and your opponent. If your opponent ranks higher
		than you, you gain more points, up to a maximum of <span class="positive">15 points</span>,
		depending on the difference in ranking. If your opponent ranks lower than you, you'll earn fewer
		points, to a minimum of <span class="positive">5 points</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the flip side, when you lose a match, you might lose points. This happens if you're beaten by
		someone ranked lower than you. The number of points you lose depends on the ranking difference,
		capped at a maximum loss of <span class="negative">5 points</span>. However, if you lose to
		someone ranked higher than you, you won't lose any points.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong> PlayerA (Rank 8) - PlayerB (Rank 5)</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>If PlayerA Wins:</dt>
		<dd>
			PlayerA wil gain: <br />10 + (Rank 8 - Rank 5 = 3) = <span class="positive">13 points</span>
		</dd>
		<dd>
			PlayerB wil lose: <br />0 + (Rank 8 - Rank 5 = 3) = <span class="negative">3 points</span>
		</dd>
		<dt>If PlayerB Wins:</dt>
		<dd>
			PlayerA wil lose: <br />0 + (Rank 5 - Rank 8 = -3) = <span class="negative">0 points</span>
		</dd>
		<dd>
			PlayerB wil gain: <br />10 + (Rank 5 - Rank 8 = -3) = <span class="positive">7 points</span>
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<h3 class="h3">Ranking</h3>
	<p>
		The ranking can be viewed by comparing to previous day, week or month. The day scores are saved
		nightly, the week scores are saved every sunday night and the month score is saved in the early
		morning on the first day of the month.
	</p>
	<p>
		The ranking is determined (ordered) by Score, Wins, Total Matches, Player Name. The comparison
		by period is occurring in the same order, but with the relative score. So Day Score, Wins, Total
		Matches, Player Name.
	</p>
	<h3 class="h3">Features</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>Win Streak: </strong> When you manage to win 3 games in a row, you wil get a ðŸ”¥ behind your
		name. You can see on the player stats page your highest achieved win streak.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Lose Streak: </strong> When you are unfortunate to lose 3 games in a row, you wil get a ðŸ’©
		behind your name. You can see on the player stats page your highest achieved lose streak.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Match History: </strong>Click the eight-ball in the bottom navigation to see the match
		history. You can also get insights in how many points you gained or lost by a match.
	</p>
	<p>

		use the player icon in the bottom bar. And find out their nemesis, highest win streak and other
		stats of the player.
	</p>

		<strong>Teams: </strong>Teams are no longer a thing in this season. Rivalry is between the
		players, not between the teams.
	</p>
